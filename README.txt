SOFTENG 206 Project - Voxspell Spelling Aid.

To execute Voxspell, first ensure your working directory is in this directory (ie. the one with this file and Voxspell.jar).

You'll need Java 8, if you're on your own computer then it's probably installed to the default java installation, so simply
enter

    java -jar Voxspell.jar

OR if you are on lab computers, then you'll need to run this instead:

    /usr/lib/jvm/jdk8/bin/java -jar Voxspell.jar


My Voxspell is aimed for the English as Second Language users demographic.

Notes:
    * I've still got to add a few (quite important) things. These include:
        * The video rewards menu (I was reworking this and didn't have time to re-add it back in).
        * A more useful Statistics screen, wth graphs.
        * Background music and sound effects.
        * Ability to practice words with a practice mode.
