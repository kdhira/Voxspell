To execute Voxspell, first ensure your working directory is in this directory (ie. the one with this file and Voxspell.jar).

You'll need Java 8, if you're on your own computer then it's probably installed to the default java installation, so simply
enter

    java -jar Voxspell.jar

OR if you are on lab computers, then you'll need to run this instead:

    /usr/lib/jvm/jdk8/bin/java -jar Voxspell.jar


My Voxspell is aimed for the English as Second Language users demographic.

Refer to khir664_Voxspell_Manual.pdf for more information on how to user Voxspell.
